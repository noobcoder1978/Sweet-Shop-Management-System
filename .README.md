# Sweet Shop Management System

A full-stack **Sweet Shop Management System** built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. This project demonstrates clean architecture, RESTful API design, secure authentication, role-based access control, frontend–backend integration, and responsible AI-assisted development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Sweet Shop Management System is designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a sweet shop. It allows users to browse available sweets, purchase items, and enables administrators to manage inventory, pricing, and stock levels efficiently.

The project is developed as an **AI Kata**, focusing on modern development practices such as TDD, clean coding, version control, and transparent AI usage.
